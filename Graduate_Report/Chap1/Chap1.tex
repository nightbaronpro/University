\section{Reasons For Choosing The Topic}
    During the time of entering the internship unit, after being briefly introduced to the systems, components and equipment 
    at BAA Training Vietnam, accompanied by the instructor's suggestion, I realized the importance of the system. The importance 
    of applying flight simulators in pilot training. \\

    But because the practice process is not too long to understand all the functions of the device. Since then, I have chosen the 
    topic of learning about the maintenance process of the flight simulator and the components related to the flight simulator for 
    this graduation internship.
