        Radar is an object detection system. It uses Microwaves to determine the range, 
        altitude, or speed of objects. The radar can transmit radio waves or microwaves 
        which bounce off any object in their path. So, we can easily determine any object 
        in the radar range. Arduino is a single-board microcontroller to make electronics 
        more discipline. The radar system has different performance specifications and also 
        it comes in a verity of size.

        RADAR is an electromagnetic system for the detection and location of target objects such as
        aircraft, ships, spacecraft, vehicles, people, and the natural environment which can refl ect a signal back. It uses
        electromagnetic radio waves to determine the angle, range, or velocity of objects. RADAR was developed
        by various nations before and during Second World War. RADAR is a classic example of an electronic
        engineering system that utilizes many of the specialized elements of technology practiced by electrical
        engineers, including signal processing, data processing, waveform design, electromagnetic scattering,
        detection, parameter estimation, information extraction, antennas, propagation transmitters, and receivers.
        This paper gives an outline of RADAR principle and some of the RADAR applications, which range from
        air traffi c control, forest and climate monitoring and the monitoring of natural disasters, to name just a few.

    \section{PRELIMINARY INTRODUCTION}
    \subsection{The reason why to choose project}
        With the passion for aviation as well as passion for technology and equipment realted to 
        it, i decided to choose an aviation-related project in this project. Fortunately, my project 
        this time is on topic of embedded programming. So, i choose project named "PSR radar 
        detector module using Arduino". In this project, i will rely 
        on the PSR radar to make a small scale PSR radar detector model. So, to get 
        started in this project, we need to know what PSR radar is and how it works. \\
    \vspace{5mm}
        Recognize the continuous development of aviation technology. I want to add my own 
        knowledge about how a radar system works and a bit of creative idea for this device 
        that came along during i make this project. And that's why i choose this project for myself. \\

    \par You may ask how the processing application works here. It's very simple, the 
    Ultrasonic sensor collects the object information with the help of Arduino and passes 
    it to processing application, there is a simple Graphics application implemented which 
    mimic a radar screen.
    \subsection{Target Research}
        The short term goal of this topic is with the desire to learn and supplement the 
        knowledge that in the course of research. With the long term goal, i want to perform 
        the topic in the best way i can. As well as improve the errors of myselft. And also, 
        i want to additional the knowledge i haven't learned at my school.
    \subsection{Object and position research}
    \vspace{3mm}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Object Research:} The object that i study is the sensor system 
        installed on the air traffic control station or installed on robots that detect 
        objects and avoid them.
            \item \textbf{Position Research:} My reserach is based on the application of radar 
        to detect missing vehicles or to apply air traffic control as call as "Primary Surveillance Radar".
        \end{itemize} 
    \subsection{Method of research}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Observation Method:} By observing directly at air traffic control 
        and also via movies or aviation videos on internet.
            \item \textbf{Method of analysis:} Looking for some similar projects that have 
        been made available online, from the detailed data of those projects, i draw some 
        methods and experience for my project. Avoid mistakes in my project.
        \end{itemize} 
    \subsection{Structure Project}

                    Arduino board sends a signal of 5V to TRIG pin of Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 
                which triggers the sensor. Then it provides rotational action at the servo motor mechanically 
                fitted along with Ultrasonic sensor so that it can detect the moving objects and locate within 
                180 degrees. \\ 
                \vspace{1mm}
                \par The Arduino sends a HIGH pulse width on the TRIGGER pin of the sensor to 
                regenerate  a series of ultrasonic waves which propagate through the air, until it touches 
                an obstacle and returns in the opposite direction towards the sensor pin ECHO. The sensor 
                detects the width of the pulse to calculate the distance. \\
                \vspace{1mm}
                \par The signal on ECHO pin of the sensor remains at the HIGH position during transmission, 
                thereby measuring the duration of the round trip of ultrasound and thus determine the distance. \\
                \vspace{1mm}
                \par The LCD displays the calculated distance and the angle of rotation. The buzzer 
                is an additional component, it rings when there is a detection (Tone 1 and Tone 2) along 
                with the LEDs. These both LEDs along with buzzer determine the field where the object is 
                located (near or distant). \\}
                \vspace{2mm}
                \par Project have a formula to calculate the distance is:
                \begin{align*}
                    \centering
                    \textbf{S = V*t}
                \end{align*}
                \par \textbf{Which is:} 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{S:} Distance from the sensor to the object.
                    \item \textbf{V:} velocity, which is 340m/s.
                    \item \textbf{t:} Width of Echo Pulse, in $\mu$S (micro second).
                    \item Distance in centimeters = Time / 58.
                    \item Distance in Inches = Time / 148
                \end{itemize}
                \vspace{2mm}
                \par In this project, will have to convert this time into centimeters to calculate the distance traveled. 
                We will use the following equation to calculate it.
                The ultrasonic wave is basically a sound wave that travels at a speed of 340m/s 
                (0.034cm/s). The ultrasonic is measuring the time it takes to hit the object and then 
                come back but we need only time that it takes to hit the object. So we will divide it by 2.
                \begin{align*}
                    \centering
                    \textbf{S = (t * 0.034)/2}

    \section{BASIC THEORY}
    \subsection{Theory about the radar}
        RADARis an electromagnetic system which is used for sensing, detecting and locating the objects present
        in the ambience. For the first time, in the year 1940
        US Navy coined the term RADAR. This system operated by transmitting an electromagnetic wave and
        detecting the reflected signal. Earlier, the RADAR was mainly developed for detecting the existence of a
        target for measuring its range, so addressed as RADAR. During the Second World War, it was first used to
        notify the approach of hostile aircraft and for routing anti aircraft weapons. The modern RADAR system
        can be used to extract much more information from the reflected signal and got broader applications but
        still the range detection is one of its important functions. Till now, there is no electronic system which can
        replace the RADAR for its accuracy and efficiency in sensing and detection. \\
        \vspace{1mm}
        \par Radar works in much the same way. The word "Radar" is stands for \textbf{RA}dio \textbf{D}etection 
        \textbf{A}nd \textbf{R}anging, and that gives a pretty big clue as to what it does and how 
        it works. Imagine an airplane flying at night through thick fog. The pilot can't see where 
        are they going, so they use the radar to help them. \\
        \vspace{1mm}
        \par An airplane's radar is a bit like a torch that uses radio waves instead of light. The 
        plane transmits and intermittent radar beam (so it sends a signal only part of the time) 
        and for the rest of the time.
    \subsection{Some research related to the project}
        Some research ideas related to my project:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The function contained in some robots, helps robots scan the terrain 
        and detect objects to avoid.
            \item Radar in the Air traffic control tower named "Primary Surveillance Radar"
        \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Theory concepts related to research issues}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{PSR(Primary Surveillance Radar)}: A Surveillance radar system which
        uses reflected radio signals.
            \item \textbf{US(Ultrasonic Sensor)}: As the name indicates, ultrasonic sensors

        power delivered by an electrical signal, by effectively chopping it up into discrete parts.
            \item \textbf{RAM(Random-Access Memory)}: is a form of computer memory that can be 
        read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.

        processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instruction that 
        make up a computer program.

                \item \textbf{Introduction about Arduino UNO}
                \linebreak
                \par Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc which is open-source 
                electronics platform mainly based on AVR microcontroller ATMega328. \\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \par First, Arduino projcet was started in Interaction Design Institute 
                Ivrea in 2003 by David Cuartielles and Massimo Banzi with the intention of 
                providing a cheap and flexible way to students and professional for controlling 
                a number of devices in the real world. \\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \par The current version of Arduino UNO comes with USB interface, 6 analog 
                input pins, 14 I/O(input/output) digital ports that are used to connect with 
                external electronic circuit. Out of 14 I/O ports, 6 pins can be used for PWM output.\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \par It allows the designers to control and sense the external electronic devices in 
                the real world. \\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \par Apart from USB, battery or AC to DC adapter(wall-wart) or battery can also be used 
                to power the board. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug 
                into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the GND and Vin pin 
                headers of the POWER connector. \\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \par The board can operate on external supply from 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, 
                however, the 5V pin may supply less than 5V and the board may become unstable. If using 
                more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range 
                is 7 to 12 volts. \\
                \vspace{3mm} 
                \par There are many versions of Uno board available. However, Arduino Uno V3 and Arduino 
                Uno are the most official versions that come with ATMega328 8-bit AVR Atmel microcontroller 
                where RAM memory is 32KB(with 0.5 KB occupied by the bootloader).

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Introduction}
                    \vspace{3mm}
                    \par Servo Motors(or servos) are self-contained electric devices that rotate or push 
                parts of machine with great precision. Servos are found in many places, from toys to home 
                electronics to cars and airplanes. If you have a radio-controlled model car, airplanes, 
                or helicopter, you are using at least a few servos. By rotating a shaft connected to the 
                engine throttle, a servo regulates the speed of a fuel-powered car or aircraft. \\
                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par Servo also appear behind the scene in devices we use every day. Electronic device 
                such as DVD players use servos to extend or retract the disc trays.

                    \end{figure}
                \item \textbf{How does a servo work?}
                    \vspace{3mm}
                    \par The simple of a servo among the features that make them so reliable. 
                The heart of a servo is a small direct current (DC) motor, similar to what you 
                might find in an cheap toy. These motors run on electricity from a battery and spin 
                at high RPM(Rotations per minute) but put out very low \textbf{torque}(a twisting force 
                used to do work you apply torque when you open a bottle).
                    \begin{figure}[H]
                        \centering

                    \end{figure}
                    \newpage
                    \par In high-power servo, the plastic gears are replaced by metal ones for strength. 
                    The motor is usually more powerful than in a low-power servo and the overall output torque 
                    can be as much as 20 times higher than a cheaper plastic one. Better quality is more 
                    expensive, and high-output servos can cost two or three times as much as standard ones.
                    \begin{figure}[H]

                    \end{figure} 
                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par With a small DC motor, you apply power from a battery, and the motor spins. 
                Unlike a simple DC motor, however, a servo's spinning motor shaft is slowed way down with 
                gears. A positional sensor on the final gear is connected to a small circuit board. The 
                sensor tells this circuit board how far the servo output shaft has rotated. The electronic 
                input signal from the computer or the radio in a remote-controlled vehicle also feeds into 
                that circuit board. The electronics on the circuit board decode the signals to determine 
                how far the user wants the servo to rotate. Then compares the desired position to the 
                actual position and decides which direction to rotate the shaft so it gets to the desired 
                position.

                \item \textbf{Types of servo motors}
                    \vspace{3mm}
                    \par Servos come in many sizes and in 3 basic types: 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Positional rotation servo:} This is the most common type of servo 
                    motor. The output shaft rotates in about half of a circle, or 180 degrees. It has physical 
                    stops placed in the gear machanism to prevent turning beyond these limits to protect the 
                    rotational sensor. These common servos are found in radio-controlled cars, aircraft, toys, 
                    robots and many applications. 
                        \item \textbf{Continuous rotation servo:} This is quite similar to the common positional 
                    rotation servo motor, except it can turn in either direction indefinitely. The control 
                    signal, rather than setting the static position of the servo, is interpreted as the direction 
                    and speed of rotation. The range of possible commands causes the servo to rotate clockwise 
                    or counterclockwise as desired, at varying speed, depending on the command signal. You might 
                    use a servo of this type on a radar dish if you mounted one on a robot. Or you could use 
                    one as a drive motor on a mobile robot.
                        \item \textbf{Linear servo:} This is also like the positional rotation servo motor described 
                    above, but with additional gears(usually a \textbf{rack and pinion} mechanism) to change 
                    the output from circular to back-and-forth. These servos are not easy to find, but you can 
                    sometimes find them at hobby stores where they are used as actuators in larger model airplanes.

                    rotate approximately 180 degrees (90 in each direction), it works just like the standard kinds 
                    but smaller. We can use any servo code, hardware or library to control this servo. It good for 
                    beginners who want to make stuff move without building a motor controller with feedback and gear

                    \end{figure}
                    \par Servo take commands from a series of pulse sent from the computer or radio. A pulse 
                is a transition from low voltage to high voltage which stays high for a short time, and then 
                returns to low. In battery devices such as servos, "low" is considered be ground or 0V 
                and "high" is the battery voltage. Servos tend to work in a range of 4.5 to 6 volts, so they 
                are extremely hobbyist computer-friendly.

                    \end{figure}
                    \par The \textbf{HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor(US)} is an ultrasonic transducer that comes with 
                4 pin interface named as Vcc, Trigger, Echo, and Ground. It is very useful for accurate distance 
                measurement of the target object and mainly works on the sound waves. \\
                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par As we connect the module to 5V and initialize the input pin, it starts transmitting 
                the sound waves which then travel through the air and hit the required object. These waves 
                hit and bounce back from the object and then collected by the receiver of the module. \\
                    \begin{figure}[H]

                        \caption{Principle of wave transmission}
                    \end{figure}
                    \par Distance is directly proportional to the time these waves require to come back at the 
                receiving end. The more the time taken, more the distance will be. \\
                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par The waves will be generating if the Trig pin is kept high for 10$\mu$S. These waves 
                will travel at the speed of sound, creating 8 cycle sonic burst that will be collected in 
                the Echo pin. \\
                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par The Echo pin remains turned on for the time these waves take to travel and bounce 
                back to the receiving end. This sensor is mainly incorporated with Arduino to measure the 
                required distance. \\
                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par Following the formula is used to calculated the distance of the object. \\
                    \begin{align*}
                        \centering
                        \textbf{S = (V*t)/2}
                    \end{align*}
                    \par Where S is the required distance, V is the speed of sound and t is the time sound 
                waves takes to come back after hitting the object. We need to divide the value by 2 because 
                time will be double as the waves travel and bounce back from the initial point. Diving it by 
                2 will give the actual distance of the target object.

                    \par A buzzer or beeper is an audio signalling device, which maybe mechanical, electromechanical, 
                    or piezoelectric(piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, 
                    timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke. \\
                    \vspace{2mm}
                    \par Buzzer is an intergrated structure of electronic transducers, DC power supply, 
                    widely used in computers, printers, copiers, alarms, electronic toys,... Active buzzer 
                    5V rated power can be directly connected to a continuous sound, this section dedicated 
                    sensor expansion module and the board in combination, can complete a simple circuit design, 
                    to "plug and play".
                \item \textbf{Types of Buzzer}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Electromechanical:} Early devices were based on an electromechanical 
                        system identical to an electric bell without the metal gong. Similarly, a relay maybe 
                        connected to interrupt its own actuating current, causing the contacts to buzz. Often these 
                        units were anchored to a wall or ceiling to use it as a sounding board. The word "buzzer" 
                        comes from the rasping noise that electromechanical buzzers made.

                        \item \textbf{Mechanical:} A joy buzzer is an example of a purely mechanical buzzer and 
                        they require drivers. Other examples of them are doorbells.

                        \item \textbf{Piezoelectric:} driven by an oscillating electronic circuit or other audio 
                        signal source, driven with a "piezoelectric audio amplifier". Sounds commonly used to indicate 
                        that a button has been pressed are a click, a ring or a beep.

                    \end{figure}
                    \par This diagram tell that Arduino is the interfaced with ultrasonic sensor. When the 
                    object is detected, the signal is given to the Arduino board which will below budget LED 
                    and LCD. That why mounted on ultrasonic sensors that will be rotating.
                \subsection{\large{Working of the project}}
                    \begin{figure}[H]
                        \centering
                        \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{img/500px-PSR_1.png}
                        \caption{PSR principle of operation}
                    \end{figure}
                    Before we learn about how to this project working. We should find out how to conventional 
                    radar work. \\ 
                    \vspace{1mm}
                    \par In Aircraft Traffic Controlled, we have PSR (Primary Surveillance Radar), the antenna 
                    rotates (usually at 5-12rpm) emits a pulse of radiio wave. Upon reaching an aircraft 
                    (or other object) the wave is reflected and some of the energy is returned to the atenna.
                    \vspace{1mm}
                    \par The output data uses polar coordinate system - it provides range and bearing of the targets 
                    found in respect of the atenna position. Note that the range is the slant distance from 
                    the atenna and not the horizontal distance. \\ 
                    \vspace{1mm}
                    \par The range is determined by the time difference of the emitted and received pulse 
                    (the speed of propagation is the speed of the light) and the bearing is obtained from the 
                    atenna azimuth. The rotation speed of the atenna is usually between 5 and 12 rpm. \\
                    \vspace{1mm}
                    \par The antenna radiation pattern is a narrow beam when seen from above and, with some 
                    approximation, can be considered as a trapezium if seen from the side. \\
                    \vspace{1mm}
                    \par For the conventional radar, here is a summary of how radar works:
                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item Magnetron generates high-frequency radio waves.
                            \item Duplexer switches magentron through the antenna.
                            \item Antenna acts as transmitter, sending narrow beam of radio waves through the air.
                            \item Radio waves hit enemy airplane and reflect back.
                            \item Atenna picks up reflected waves during a break between transmissions. Note that the same antenna 
                            acts as both transmitter and receiver, alternately sending out radio waves and receiving them.
                            \item Duplexer switches antenna through to receiver unit.
                            \item Computer in receiver unit processes reflected waves and draws them on TV screen.
                            \item Enemy plane shows up on TV radar display with any other nearby targets. 
                        \end{enumerate}

            \subsection{PROGRAM MY BOARD}
                In this project, unlike almost the tutorials on the Internet, i'll use Visual Studio Code 
                to embed code to my Arduino board which was written with C++ programming languague.  
                \begin{figure}[H]

                    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/program.png}
                    \caption{Embed code to the program}
                \end{figure}
        \section{ENFORCEMMENT RESULT}
            When the radar detect an objects within the safe range, a green notification 
            light will appear. 
            \begin{figure}[H]

                \caption{An object in the safe range}
            \end{figure}
            Other ways, if the radar detect an object within the dangerous range, a red notification 
            light will appear.

            \subsection{\large{Advantages}}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The project works well.
                    \item The sensor works well, from which it scan objects and detect them, then 
                    display them on the LCD screen.
                    \item The circuit diagram and wiring of this project aren't too complicated to be 
                    able to do.
                    \item The operating range of the sensor can scan in a range of distance of 2-400 cm.
                \end{itemize}
            \subsection{\large{Defects}}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Too much wire to connect all the component.
                    \item The components of this project are quite expensive.
                \end{itemize}
        \section{RECOMMENDATIONS}
            In this project, i think i should be broader and more advanced than the present one, 
            looking for ways to overcome the cumbersome wiring in this project. Besides, myself also 
            need to be more careful and focused when implementing the project.
